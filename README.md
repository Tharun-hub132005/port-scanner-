## Port Scanner Using Pytho ##
# Requirements:
 *  Python
 * socket and threading modules
*  Command-line interface
# Ethical Hacking: 
Using tools like port scanners requires permission from the network owner. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical. This script is for educational purposes and responsible use only.

# Basic Assessment:
This script provides a very basic level of assessment. True vulnerability assessment involves much more sophisticated tools and methodologies (e.g., vulnerability scanners like Nessus, OpenVAS, Metasploit, etc.).

# Firewalls and IDS/IPS:
Modern networks often have firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) that can detect and block port scans. Be aware that your scans might be detected and potentially trigger alerts.

# Performance and Threading: 
While threading helps, scanning a large range of ports on many hosts can still be time-consuming. 
# How to Use the Script:

* Save:Save the code as a Python file (e.g., port_scanner.py).

* Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
* Run:
* Scan a specific IP with default common ports (recommended for quick checks):
* Bash

python port_scanner.py your_target_ip_or_hostname -c
# Scan a specific IP for a single port:

* Bash

python port_scanner.py your_target_ip -p 22
# Scan a specific IP for a list of ports:

 * Bash

python port_scanner.py your_target_ip -p 21,22,80,443
# Scan a specific IP for a range of ports:

* Bash

python port_scanner.py your_target_ip -p 1-1024
Scan with a custom timeout:

* Bash

python port_scanner.py your_target_ip -p 1-100 -t 0.5
# Scan a hostname:

Bash

python port_scanner.py example.com -c
